  "summary": "The document is a classified CIA report from October 24, 1961, detailing the internal resistance movement in Cuba, known as the Movimiento Revolucionario del Pueblo (MRP), under the leadership of Manolo Ray. It highlights the MRP's stance against an invasion of Cuba, its widespread organization and support among the Cuban populace, the absence of U.S. support, and the expectation of Fidel Castro's overthrow. Additionally, it warns of the potential for civil war post-Castro's downfall.",
  "key_findings": [
    "Manolo Ray, as the leader of the MRP, strongly opposed any invasion of Cuba, favoring Castro's overthrow through internal resistance.",
    "The MRP had a broad organizational structure across Cuba, enjoying support from various sectors such as trade unions and the military, with an estimated 80% of the population's backing, though not all were actively against Castro.",
    "Despite facing shortages in arms and explosives, the MRP was strengthening its position without any assistance from U.S. sources that supported the invasion.",
    "The Cuban resistance viewed exiles with indifference to contempt, preferring financial support and the return of trained exiles, particularly communication experts, over the establishment of a Cuban government in exile.",
    "Ray anticipated Castro's downfall within a year, cautioning about the ensuing dangerous situation and the possibility of civil war."
