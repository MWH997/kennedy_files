  "summary": "The document is a classified contact report from September 1993, detailing a meeting between intelligence operatives (DAGGERS) and their handler in Mexico City. It covers operational activities such as the collection of photos and intelligence, the issuance of an unassembled CD for the KDPEEK operation, and salary payments to operatives H/18 and H/31. Notably, it mentions the return of Shulipin, a former Russian embassy official, without any change in rank or duties, raising suspicions. The report also expresses concerns over the CISN's decision to stop providing photo negatives for the KDPEEK operation, with plans to investigate the reason behind this change. Security measures during the meeting, including surveillance avoidance tactics, and considerations for scheduling future meetings around Mexican holidays and traffic conditions, are also outlined.",
