  "summary": "The document is a dispatch from 1963 detailing the recruitment and training of an unidentified candidate by AMERD-1 (Peter J. Di Cepveno) in Havana during the fall of 1960. Initially spotted by AMPANIC-1, the candidate underwent training in clandestine operations, including the use of an RS-1 set, signal plans, and coding/decoding techniques. Despite this training, the candidate was never activated and remained on standby. The document seeks assistance from Headquarters to locate the candidate for potential operational use, highlighting that contacting AMPANIC-1 is not advisable due to security concerns.",
