  "summary": "The document is a confidential communication regarding the proposed declassification and release of a British Security Service (BSS) document related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy under the JFK Assassination Records Act of 1992. It discusses the review and potential redactions of sensitive information pertaining to US/UK intelligence relationships and methods before release to the JFK Assassination Review Board. The document pertains to a 1963 interview by the BSS of Lillian Sloboda, wife of a defector to the USSR, relevant to the time of JFK's assassination. CIA obtained the document from a foreign friendly service, making it difficult to deny its release in full. Proposed redactions include references to BSS, CIA, and FBI to protect intelligence relationships and methods. The document does not appear to affect current CIA equities or be damaging to UK interests in a sanitized form. A response was requested by the end of Thursday, 30 July, to address any serious objections from BSS.",
