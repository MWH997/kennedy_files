  "summary": "The memorandum, dated 2 August 1978, from S.D. Breckinridge to the General Counsel and Director of Security, addresses a request by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) regarding any agreements between the CIA and FBI on reporting U.S. citizens abroad who engage with Communist embassies or officials. It confirms the absence of such agreements, citing current legislation that prohibits the CIA from reporting on these contacts. Additionally, it highlights the constraints imposed by Executive Orders 11905 and 12036 on reporting about U.S. persons. The document concludes with a request for coordination with the Directorate of Operations (DDO) to formulate the Agency's response to the HSCA's inquiry.",
