  "summary": "The document is a memorandum from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to the Executive Director of the Assassination Records Review Board, dated 13 December 1996. It discusses the CIA's concerns regarding the release of the true names of human sources of intelligence within the JFK Collection under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992. The CIA emphasizes the risks to the safety and lives of these sources and their families if their identities are disclosed, given the nature of espionage and the confidentiality promised to them. The memorandum outlines legal and operational considerations for protecting these identities, referencing various statutes and executive orders that support the protection of intelligence sources. It proposes a policy of substituting true names with identifiers to protect sources while allowing for the release of information that does not compromise their safety.",
