  "summary": "The memorandum from William H. Godson to the Chief of the Counterintelligence Staff details Herbert Itkin's dual role as an unpaid informant for the CIA on Haitian exile activities in 1963 and his subsequent involvement with the FBI in domestic issues, focusing on the Mafia. It also covers Itkin's personal legal battles, including false claims about CIA involvement in a custody dispute, and the implications for CIA staff agent Bernard E. MONCURE. The document underscores the defensive nature of the file, MONCURE's status, and the potential legal consequences of the disclosed information.",

    "Itkin and his wife were involved in legal disputes over child custody, during which they falsely alleged CIA involvement.",
