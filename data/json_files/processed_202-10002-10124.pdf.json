  "summary": "The document comprises memoranda and reports detailing the U.S. government's contingency planning and discussions regarding potential retaliatory actions by the Castro government in Cuba during the 1960s. It focuses on the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, U.S.-Cuba relations, and includes extensive planning on psychological programs, military contingency plans, and interdepartmental coordination to mitigate possible Cuban threats against U.S. interests, Cuban exiles, and Latin America.",
  "key_findings": [
    "Contingency plans were developed for scenarios such as the Cuban government cutting off water supply to Guantanamo, restricting base access to Cuban workers, and acts of sabotage.",
    "Standing operating procedures and rules of engagement were in place to protect against and respond to Cuban actions, including radio jamming and harassment of U.S. ships.",
    "Psychological programs were emphasized to counteract Cuban influence in Latin America, particularly targeting left-wing labor movements.",
    "A cautious strategy was adopted to avoid provoking the Castro regime into actions necessitating major U.S. military retaliation, while also preparing for a potential full-scale military invasion of Cuba.",
    "Concerns were raised about Castro's backing of subversive elements in Latin America, perceived as a more significant long-term threat than direct confrontations."
