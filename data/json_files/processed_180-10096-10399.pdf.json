He mentioned Oswald's time in Russia, his lack of social graces, and minimal discussions about his life there. Taylor also noted Oswald's interest in writing, his possession of a rifle, and Marina Oswald's apparent fear of him. Additionally, Taylor speculated on George De Mohrenschildt's unusual interest in Oswald and hinted at a possible confession among De Mohrenschildt's papers.",
