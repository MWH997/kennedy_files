It addresses the issue of releasing the true names of CIA employees found in the JFK Collection, advocating for a policy that protects these names unless they are crucial to the historical record of the JFK assassination. The memo details the legal and operational reasons for safeguarding the identities of CIA employees, highlighting potential risks to national security and personal safety, and recommends the use of name substitutions in cases where the employees' connection to the JFK story is minimal.",
