  "summary": "The document outlines tests on modified sights for the 7.62 Belgian (FAL) Rifle, specifically evaluating a Williams Peep sight and a Japanese 2X scope under adverse weather conditions. The Williams sight demonstrated acceptable performance with a broad elevation range despite inconsistent results, whereas the Japanese scope was found impractical due to mounting and zeroing challenges. The analysis also highlighted erratic performance linked to underloaded ammunition, suggesting insufficient case expansion from low pressures. Recommendations propose abandoning the scope, adjusting the Williams sight's click mechanism, and conducting additional tests on underloaded ammunition.",
