  "summary": "The document requests the expertise of a Collins Modem Field Service Engineer for the setup and testing of newly acquired Collins Radio Company Model TE-216D-15D High Frequency Data Modems. These modems are to be used for evaluating the feasibility of secure (encrypted) voice and high-speed data transmission over narrow band, high frequency radio circuits. The request highlights the complexity of the modems necessitating a specialist, provides an estimate for the duration (six to eight weeks starting around 6 March 1967) and cost (approximately $2,000 per month plus travel expenses) of the engineer's services, and notes the engineer's TOP SECRET clearance effective from 19 May 1965.",
