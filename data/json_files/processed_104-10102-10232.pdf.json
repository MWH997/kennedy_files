  "summary": "The document is a CIA memorandum from 14 February 1977, focusing on Nestor Antonio MORENO Lopez (AMICE-27), a Cuban lawyer involved in anti-BATISTA and anti-CASTRO activities. After defecting to Miami, MORENO associated with anti-CASTRO exiles and co-authored the Leonardo Plan, which became the AMTRUNK Operation. However, his indiscretions and distrust of the CIA led to his termination from the operation in 1963 and from the Rebel Army Radio Program in 1964. The memorandum concludes that while MORENO was not a CASTRO agent, his actions jeopardized the operation's security. He later moved to South Carolina to teach Spanish.",
