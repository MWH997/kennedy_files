  "summary": "The document is a memorandum from 2 June 1965, summarizing a meeting on 25 May 1965 involving AMBUNNY-1, AMWHIP-1, and an individual known as Al MARIN. The discussion focused on operational concerns related to AMBUNNY-1's background, particularly her previous employment with the U.S. Ambassador in Bolivia, and the risks this posed. There were specific worries about the potential exposure of connections with ODYOKE and UNSNAFU-19 if AMBUNNY-1's role was uncovered by the Cubans. The idea of using a cutout to introduce AMBUNNY-1 to the UNSNAFU-19 installation was proposed as a security measure, with further details to be determined. Additionally, the Paris operation was canceled, and alternative roles for AMBUNNY-1 were considered.",
