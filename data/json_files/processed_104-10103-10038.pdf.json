  "summary": "The document is a memorandum from 27 February 1974, addressed to the Inspector General, detailing an investigation into payments made to Howard Hunt during his non-official cover assignment in Madrid. The Office of Finance reviewed various financial records to trace payments to Hunt, finding all accounted for except a $1,600 expenditure for a sensitive operation, which was approved for write-off. The investigation noted the unusual charging of all assignment costs to the BUR Division's support allotment, atypical for non-official cover assignments. It recommended further inquiries into Hunt's operational expenditures and a review of Monetary's cashier's checks records.",
