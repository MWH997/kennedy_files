Instead, Ray advocated for Castro's overthrow through internal resistance. The report outlines the MRP's extensive organization across Cuba, including its presence in all 33 trade unions, the G-2, militia, and the administration, and its broad support among the Cuban population. Ray estimated that 80% of Cubans opposed Castro, though not all were actively resisting.",
