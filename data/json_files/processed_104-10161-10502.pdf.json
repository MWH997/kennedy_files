It details the death of Adrian Fisher Sherman, Jr., on 23 September 1978, from a heart attack, and outlines the security concerns arising from his death. Sherman, who had a history with the Agency and was of interest to the DCD and FRD, was found with a missing document related to a plan to assassinate Fidel Castro, among other personal items.
