  "summary": "The document is a memorandum from Arthur Schlesinger Jr. to the President, dated June 10, 1961, discussing the reorganization of the CIA. It highlights issues with CIA's covert operations, particularly in Cuba and Singapore, and their impact on U.S. foreign policy. The memorandum suggests that the current system of notifying the State Department of covert operations is inadequate and proposes earlier involvement of the State Department in the planning stages of such operations to better align them with U.S. foreign policy interests.",
