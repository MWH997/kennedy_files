  "summary": "The document comprises memoranda and talking points from the CIA to the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), focusing on the protection of the cryptonym IJDECANTER related to the JFK assassination records. The CIA expresses concerns over the potential harm to US intelligence interests and the risk to Russian counterintelligence if the actual cryptonym is disclosed.
