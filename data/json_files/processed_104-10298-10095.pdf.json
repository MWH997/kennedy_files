  "summary": "The document is a historical FBI memorandum from April 1963 that explores the internal conflicts and political challenges within the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC), particularly focusing on Dr. Jose Miro Cardona's attempted resignation and retention as president. It sheds light on the strained relations between the CRC and the U.S. government, stemming from disagreements over U.S. policies towards Cuba and the perceived lack of support for Cuban exiles' efforts to overthrow Castro's regime. The memorandum also captures the widespread frustration among Cuban exiles in Miami, who felt neglected by the U.S. government, alongside Castro's assertion that the U.S. had conceded to one of his demands to ease Caribbean tensions by curbing armed attacks on Cuba by exiles.",
