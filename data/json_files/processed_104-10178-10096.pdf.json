It highlights the collaborative efforts between the FBI, CIA (specifically JMWAVE operations), and the Department of Justice in tracking fugitives and probing bombings in Miami. The narrative underscores the strategic use of informants for intelligence gathering on illegal activities, alongside the legal hurdles in prosecuting these cases, particularly the necessity for evidence of interstate commerce in illicit materials. Additionally, it touches on operational dilemmas like informant safety and the risk of entrapment in sting operations.",
