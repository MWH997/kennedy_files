  "summary": "The document is a declassified record associated with the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992, focusing on a former member of Castro's forces who defected in 1950. This individual became active in anti-Castro groups in Florida, engaging in Cuban exile activities before the Bay of Pigs invasion. Recruited by the Miami Station, they served as a radio operator and infiltrator in the early 1960s. Their involvement extended to the 'Movimiento Democrata Cristiano' (MDC) and later missions with the 'Junta Militar de Cuban', including clandestine operations within Cuba. The document notes their U.S. alien registration but lacks details on the final outcome of their missions.",
