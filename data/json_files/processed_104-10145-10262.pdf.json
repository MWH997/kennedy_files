  "summary": "The document is a confidential addendum to a journal from the Office of Legislative Counsel dated 6 July 1978. It discusses concerns and actions related to the potential exposure of sensitive information by the House Select Committee on Assassinations in open forums, including details on the Nosenko case and Mexico operations. It outlines the limited role of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence due to its charter restrictions and suggests the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) may need to address these concerns with Chairman Stokes and possibly the President. Additionally, it covers a request by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence staff for contact information of a former Agency employee, Newton S. Miler, and the Agency's response, highlighting the ongoing obligations of retired employees under secrecy agreements.",
