  "summary": "The AMSPELL exhibit toured six Latin American countries from February to June 1964 under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992. The tour's outcomes varied, with notable successes in Guayaquil and La Paz, but it faced failures in Quito, Santiago, and Montevideo due to organizational challenges and the team's inexperience. Despite these issues, the tour attracted an estimated 6,720 exhibit viewers and 2,792 conference attendees, alongside significant media coverage. The operation, costing around $12,000 and funded by KUBARK, was deemed not suitable for repetition under similar conditions.",
