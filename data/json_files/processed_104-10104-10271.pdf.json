  "summary": "The document provides an in-depth look into the covert operations of Ace Marine Survey, Inc. and Ceres Enterprises, Inc., under the control of JMWAVE, focusing on their roles in maritime activities. These corporations were instrumental in providing cover for maritime vessels, managing payrolling agents, and conducting marine research, with their operations funded through covert accounts at the First National Bank of Miami. The document also discusses their tax status, the security of their cover mechanisms, and the eventual dormancy or termination of their activities following security incidents.",
  "key_findings": [
    "Ace Marine Survey, Inc., previously known as Ace Cartography Company, provided cover for the M/V SONORA, including managing payrolling agents and securing berthing sites.",
    "Ceres Enterprises, Inc. was established to operate boats for marine research, offering cover for the M/V BARB and the M/V JADE, and also handled payrolling agents.",
    "Funding for both corporations was channeled through covert accounts at the First National Bank of Miami, with strategies in place to conceal the origins of the funds.",
    "In 1967, assessments concluded that while the cover mechanisms were generally secure, specific incidents, like an agent's capture in Cuba, led to the cessation or dormancy of the corporations' operations.",
    "The document underscores the strategic use of legitimate businesses to support and deepen the cover stories for covert operations."
