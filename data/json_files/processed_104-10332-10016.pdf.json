  "summary": "The document is a memorandum from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to the Executive Director of the Assassination Records Review Board, dated 13 December 1996. It addresses the CIA's concerns about releasing the true names of human sources within the JFK Collection under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992. The memorandum details the potential risks of revealing these identities, such as harm to the individuals and their families, damage to intelligence operations, and implications for U.S. Government policy on protecting intelligence sources. It suggests methods like using generic identifiers or code names in released documents to mitigate these risks.",
