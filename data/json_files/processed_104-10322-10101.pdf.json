  "summary": "The document is a memorandum dated 29 November 1978, addressed to the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, discussing a briefing for Chairman Stokes of the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) regarding an operation code-named KITTY HAWK. It reveals that KITTY HAWK is a sensitive in-place KGB source, not a defector, and discusses the source's limited information on the Kennedy assassination, including impressions that it was planned by VIPs possibly due to Kennedy's opposition to Texas oil interests, and mentions a KGB disinformation campaign to blame President Johnson. The document also touches on the relevance of KITTY HAWK's support for Nosenko's bona fides in the context of KGB defector theories.",
