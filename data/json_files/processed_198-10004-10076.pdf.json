  "summary": "The document provides an in-depth look at the U.S. policy towards Cuba during the early 1960s, particularly around the Cuban Missile Crisis. It encompasses a range of strategies including political, economic, psychological, and military actions aimed at isolating and undermining the Castro regime, with the ultimate goal of its overthrow and replacement by a government favorable to U.S. interests. The policy emphasized the importance of multilateral support, especially through the Organization of American States (OAS), to maintain hemispheric solidarity against Cuba. It also detailed contingency plans for military actions, covert operations, and economic sanctions, alongside considerations for the moral and strategic implications of disbanding the Cuban Brigade.",
