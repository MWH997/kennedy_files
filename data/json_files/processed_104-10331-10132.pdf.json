Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992. The discussion centered on ensuring comprehensive searches for JFK assassination-related files and the importance of transparency in the document release process to assure the public that all reasonable efforts were made to locate and disclose relevant documents.",
  "key_findings": [
    "The ARRB aimed to ensure public confidence in the thoroughness of the search for and release of JFK assassination-related documents, recognizing the challenge of guaranteeing all documents were found.",
    "Documents were classified into three categories: sequestered records and Oswald 201 file, additional information/special requests, and records not previously identified.",
    "The CIA faced difficulties in confirming the location of all records due to the absence of a central file system and challenges in tracking the disposition of records from 1963.",
    "Further searches were planned in specific offices and files, including DCI files, Richard Helms' files, and various DO and DI offices.",
    "Concerns were raised about the CIA's records management practices, including the existence of record centers, inventories, and procedures for name traces and specific hit searches."
