It underscores Angleton's distinctive authority to manage sensitive intelligence projects, notably those involving the Israeli Intelligence Service, and his direct reporting to the CIA Director. The memorandum concludes with a suggestion to phase out the control file for specific materials by 1967, citing its diminished relevance.",
