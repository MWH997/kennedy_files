  "summary": "The document is a memorandum from Fredrick C. Wickham, Jr., the DO Focal Point for ARRB, to the Chief of the Historical Review Group, dated 11 December 1995. It details the DO's opposition to the release of specific information concerning ERTHYROID/3, a Nicaraguan interrogator, under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992.
