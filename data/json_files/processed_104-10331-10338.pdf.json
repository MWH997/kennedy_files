  "summary": "The memorandum from Barry Harrelson to John Pereira, dated 26 February 1997, addresses the delicate balance between public transparency and national security in the context of releasing CIA employees' names in documents related to the JFK assassination. It underscores the ARRB's initial agreement to protect these names until May 1997, citing the need for thorough document review and the potential risks to national security and covert operations. The document advocates for a strategic approach to name release, focusing on individuals directly linked to the JFK assassination while using pseudonyms for others, and outlines a plan to engage with the ARRB to refine these protections.",
