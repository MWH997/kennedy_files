  "summary": "The memorandum details a meeting on 29 October 1975 between the Chief of Counterintelligence (CI) and Mr. Paul Wallach, Chief Counsel of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, discussing concerns over the CIA's partial disclosure of files related to the Lee Harvey Oswald case and the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The CIA acknowledged the challenges in sharing sensitive information without risking the exposure of sources, methods, and liaison relationships.
