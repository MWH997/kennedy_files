  "summary": "The document is a transcript of Richard M. Goodwin's testimony before the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities on July 10, 1975. It details the United States' policy and actions towards the Dominican Republic, focusing on the assassination of Rafael Trujillo. Goodwin discusses the transfer of arms to dissident groups, the intentions behind these actions, and the Kennedy administration's efforts to distance itself from political assassinations. The testimony sheds light on the complexities of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America during the Cold War, including the moral dilemmas of covert operations and regime change.",
