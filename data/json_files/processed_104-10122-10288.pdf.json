  "summary": "The memorandum dated 20 May 1971 outlines the activities of Robert D. Peloquin, President of International Intelligence, Inc. (INTERTEL), particularly its investigation into Robert A. Maheu on behalf of the Hughes Tool Company. Initially established to steer companies clear of Mafia associations, INTERTEL's role evolved to include investigative tasks, leading to its engagement in probing Maheu's dealings with Howard Hughes. The document also touches on allegations connecting INTERTEL to organized crime, the participation of ex-FBI agents and IRS personnel in its operations, and the ensuing legal and financial conflicts between Maheu and the Hughes Tool Company.",
