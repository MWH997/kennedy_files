  "summary": "The document is a classified CIA field report from 24 August 1962, detailing Antonio Varona Loredo's mission to Panama on behalf of the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC) to seek support against the Castro regime. Varona proposed a meeting of Central American leaders to discuss Cuba and requested the establishment of a training base for Cuban exiles in Panama. Despite initial consideration, Panamanian President Roberto Chiari, after consulting his government, denied the training base request. The report also alludes to unconfirmed plans for a Cuban government-in-exile in Panama under Dr. Jose Miro Cardona.",
