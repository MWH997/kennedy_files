  "summary": "The memorandum from the Directorate of Science and Technology addresses the House Select Committee on Assassinations' (HSCA) request under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992. It details the U-2 Project's Detachment C operations in Atsugi, Japan, from 1957 to 1960, covering missions, Soviet awareness of the U-2 program, and their protests over airspace violations. The document also highlights the difficulties in retrieving specific information due to the broad scope of the requests and the historical context of these operations.",
  "key_findings": [
    "Detachment C of the U-2 Project was stationed in Atsugi, Japan, starting in 1957, where it carried out missions, including overflights over the USSR.",
    "The initial USSR overflight from Atsugi took place on March 1, 1958, prompting a Soviet protest.",
    "Evidence suggests the Soviets were aware of the U-2 program before the Francis Gary Powers incident on May 1, 1960, with documented responses to U-2 overflights by Soviet air defenses.",
    "The response to the HSCA's inquiries was complicated by the broad and non-specific nature of the requests, alongside challenges in locating precise information due to the historical and organizational context of the files."
