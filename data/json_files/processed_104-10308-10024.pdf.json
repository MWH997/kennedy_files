  "summary": "The document is a memorandum from November 1976, released under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992, focusing on the Cuban Revolutionary Council (CRC). It outlines the CRC's formation in New York City in March 1961, aimed at unifying Cuban exile groups under U.S. Government guidance. The memorandum sheds light on the disillusionment among exiles due to the perceived U.S. abandonment of plans to liberate Cuba, touching on issues such as resignations, coalitions, agreements, infighting, political aspirations, organizational structure, and financing. Additionally, it references a 1963 cable detailing exile reactions to travel restrictions and a 1962 dispatch about the CRC's restructuring and concerns regarding non-CIA support to Cuban exiles.",
