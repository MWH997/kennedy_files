  "summary": "The document is a confidential FBI memorandum from September 25, 1964, detailing the investigation into the mistaken attack on the Spanish vessel 'Sierra Aranzazu' by the anti-Castro exile group Movimiento de Recuperacion Revolucionaria (MRR), which had U.S. backing. The attack, which resulted in the deaths of three Spaniards, caused diplomatic tensions between the U.S. and Spain.
