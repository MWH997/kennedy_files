  "summary": "The document discusses the USG's Assassination Record Review Board (ARRB) efforts to access BKGB records related to Lee Harvey Oswald's time in Minsk, as part of the investigation into President John F. Kennedy's assassination. It outlines past attempts to obtain these records, the BKGB's reluctance to release them due to privacy laws, and the potential reactivation of these efforts. The document also highlights complications arising from author Norman Mailer's prior access to some of these records for his book, 'Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery'.",
  "key_findings": [
    "The ARRB sought BKGB records on Lee Harvey Oswald's stay in Minsk for scholarly review.",
    "BKGB cited privacy laws to deny full record release, especially concerning living Belarusians like Oswald's former wife, Marina.",
    "Previous attempts in 1996 to obtain records were unsuccessful, with BKGB only willing to answer specific questions.",
    "Norman Mailer's access to some BKGB records for his book 'Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery' complicated matters, as BKGB felt cheated for not benefiting from the arrangement.",
    "The ARRB's mandate was extended to 1998, renewing interest in accessing BKGB records, with potential future meetings facilitated by the embassy."
