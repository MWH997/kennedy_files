  "summary": "The document, classified as SECRET and dated May 1978, is a deferred telecommunication that discusses the reluctance of 'ADTRUST' to share information concerning the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO) and its potential contacts with Americans. This hesitation stems from concerns over the Freedom of Information Act and the risk of leaks, highlighting a tension between the necessity of information sharing and the protection of sensitive sources and methods. The communication also references a past incident involving an American Nazi Party member's brief encounter with the VMO in 1977, illustrating the challenges in persuading ADTRUST to disclose information despite assurances of handling it as classified and sensitive. It reflects broader apprehensions about safeguarding sources and methods amidst congressional inquiries.",
