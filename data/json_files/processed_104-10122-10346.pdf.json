  "summary": "The document outlines two CIA covert operations, Project HARPSTAK and Project NORFOLK, which employed female operatives to influence foreign leadersâ€”President Sukarno of Indonesia and King Hussein of Jordan, respectively. Project HARPSTAK aimed to exploit Sukarno's affinity for women to gather intelligence and sway his decisions, albeit with limited success due to timing constraints. Project NORFOLK facilitated King Hussein's female companionship during his U.S. visit, ensuring secure meetings and managing communications post-visit. Robert Maheu was instrumental in both operations, sourcing candidates and organizing encounters, despite his involvement being occasionally concealed. These operations exemplify the CIA's strategic use of personal relationships and psychological tactics for intelligence and influence during the Cold War.",
