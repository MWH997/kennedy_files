  "summary": "The document is a memorandum from 28 July 1975, outlining the CIA's interactions with George R. Wackenhut and the Wackenhut Corporation. Initially, in May 1960, the CIA opened files on Wackenhut for cover support in Florida, leading to his Covert Security Approval in November 1961. This approval enabled his company to support CIA employees in Miami. However, by April 1967, due to Wackenhut's notoriety in Florida, the CIA rescinded his approval and ended their relationship. Despite this, by November 1974, it was observed that Wackenhut Corporation was providing guard services to Global Marine Development, Incorporated (GMDI), a company associated with the CIA's DDS&T office, without the CIA's intervention to stop the contract.",
