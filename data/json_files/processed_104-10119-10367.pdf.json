  "summary": "The document is a memorandum from 20 February 1970, detailing the establishment and operations of the Alexander Herzen Foundation by Karel van het Reve in Amsterdam. The foundation was created to publish the works of Soviet dissenters, ensuring their rights were protected against piracy and that their works were published with their consent in the West. It outlines the foundation's process of first publishing manuscripts in their original Russian before making them available to Western publishers, and its commitment to collecting royalties for the authors, including exploring payment methods through the Soviet State Bank. The foundation is characterized as apolitical, with the primary goal of providing Soviet dissenters a platform to publish their works.",
