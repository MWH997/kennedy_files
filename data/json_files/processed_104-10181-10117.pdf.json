  "summary": "The document is a CIA memorandum, released under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992, which explores the potential animosity the DRE (Student Revolutionary Directorate) harbored towards President Kennedy. It details the author's involvement with JMWAVE from Spring 1961 to late summer 1963, focusing on funding the DRE's overseas operations. The memorandum also examines the DRE's possible connections to Lee Harvey Oswald and speculates on whether the group's dissatisfaction with Kennedy's Cuba policies could have motivated a desire for revenge.",
