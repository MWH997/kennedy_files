  "summary": "The document is a declassified record under the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992, focusing on Evelio Duque, a Cuban anti-communist activist. It details his opposition to both the Batista and Castro regimes, his collaboration with the CIA under the codename JMWAVE, and his leadership role in the Ejercito Cubano Anticommunista (ECA). The document highlights his efforts to garner international support against Castro's regime through the OAS and UN, a period of inactivity from 1966 to 1973 due to financial constraints, and explicitly denies any involvement in drug trafficking.",
