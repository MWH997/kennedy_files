  "summary": "The document is a classified message from London, dated October 1961, detailing the views of Manolo Ray, leader of the People's Revolutionary Movement (MRP) in Cuba. Ray opposed a military invasion of Cuba, advocating for Castro's overthrow through internal resistance. He asserted that the MRP enjoyed broad support within Cuba, including among trade unions, the military, and the administration, with 80% of the population allegedly opposed to Castro, albeit not actively resisting. The MRP faced shortages of arms and explosives and had not received support from the United States. The internal resistance was reportedly indifferent or hostile towards exile groups, desiring financial aid and the return of trained exiles, particularly communication specialists. Ray forecasted Castro's downfall within a year but cautioned about the ensuing dangers.",
