Kennedy Assassination Records Act of 1992. It outlines the criteria and deliberations involved in releasing documents, including those concerning covert operations, the alias documentation of ex-CIA personnel, organizational structures of CIA components from 1958-1968, surveillance recordings from Cuban and Soviet establishments in Mexico City during the assassination period, and the personal files of CIA operatives such as LITAMIL-9 and Richard Gibson. The narrative underscores the delicate equilibrium between the public's right to know and the imperative to safeguard classified information.",
