  "summary": "The document is a letter from Richard Helms, Director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization, to Sir Charles C. F. Spry, Director General, regarding the declassification status of Warren Commission documents Cu-371 and Cu-372. It references an August 1968 inquiry that anticipated but did not encounter pressure for the release of Warren Commission papers. The letter concludes with the decision not to release Cu-372 at present and cites Sir Charles's arguments as justification for maintaining the document's classified status if questioned in the future.",
