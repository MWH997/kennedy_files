  "summary": "The document is a secret memorandum detailing the case of Samuel Adason Jaffe, who was allegedly recruited by the KGB in 1962 during his time in Moscow through a relationship with a Soviet female. Jaffe reported this recruitment effort to the New York Office in 1963, leading to extensive interviews. Following these allegations, FBI agents became more cautious in their dealings with him. Jaffe expressed concerns that his association with the FBI might be negatively impacting his employment opportunities. The memorandum also notes Jaffe's interactions with British and CIA contacts in Hong Kong, where he reported on Communist Chinese individuals of interest. It concludes with a recommendation to refer Jaffe's case to the SENSTUDY project in anticipation of potential inquiries from SSCLO.",
